// IN Javascript we need to have an initializer before declaring a variable. In ES6 we have two types of initializers i.e

// let :  It declares values which can be changed later on.
// Hoisting
let weight = 10.5

console.log(weight)

// const : It is used to declare variables which contains values are not intended to be changed in the entire program
const pi= 3.142
console.log("The pi is", pi)

// variable declaration should start with let or const
// variable names : must start with a letter,underscore or a dollar sign; cannot use javascript reserved  words(let,class); case sensitive.

//Naming conventions
// Camel case-the first word starts with a small letter and the others caps eg userAge
//Pascal case - Caps eg PascalCase
//Snake case - words separated by an underscore
